     Mr. Miller needs your help once again! Ever since his eight cards were returned, he got ten more cards! With 18 cards total, Miller was content. That was until he lost the cards once again! He really needs a card holder. You have been tasked with finding the 18 Peter Griffin cards hidden around Mr. Miller's rooms. This time around, you will be required to move things around the room to find the cards hidden in their places. Hints will be dropped on the website every once a while, so if you see one, try and find the card(s) associated with it! What epic loot may you get from this quest? You will find out if you find enough!
